Pathogens
======================================

The Nextstrain team maintains `analyses of several selected pathogens <pathogens_>`_, such as SARS-CoV-2_ and influenza_, to show pathogen evolution and epidemic spread.
We continually update our results as new data is made publicly available by re-running our :term:`core workflows <core workflow>`.

A wider array of pathogens is analyzed by Nextstrain community members, who share the results in their `Nextstrain Groups`_ and via GitHub with `Nextstrain Community`_.
