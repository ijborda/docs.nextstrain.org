Style guide
===========

This is the (fledgling) style guide for Nextstrain's documentation.


Capitalization
==============

Capitalize the names of our projects, like Nextstrain, Augur, Auspice,
Nextstrain CLI, etc.

Do not capitalize the eponymous commands of our projects, e.g. ``augur``,
``auspice``, ``nextstrain``.


Titles
======

Use short titles in the entries of ``toctree`` directives (i.e. the site
navigation tree) to keep the navigation sidebar easily scannable.  It's ok for
the title of the page itself to be longer/different.
