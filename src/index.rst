======================================
Welcome to Nextstrain's documentation!
======================================

Nextstrain is an open-source project to harness the scientific and public health potential of pathogen genome data.
We provide a continually-updated view of publicly available data with powerful analyses and visualizations showing pathogen evolution and epidemic spread.
Our goal is to aid epidemiological understanding and improve outbreak response and we currently maintain the following tools to help you to analyze and visualize your own data:
 - `Augur <https://docs.nextstrain.org/projects/augur/en/stable/index.html>`_ (phylogenetic analysis)
 - `Auspice <https://docs.nextstrain.org/projects/auspice/en/stable/index.html>`_ (visualization)
 - `Nextstrain CLI <https://docs.nextstrain.org/projects/cli/en/stable/index.html>`_ (command line utility)
 - `Nextclade <https://docs.nextstrain.org/projects/nextclade/en/latest/index.html>`_ (QC, clade assignment, mutation calling)

If you have any questions, or simply want to say hi, please give us a shout at hello@nextstrain.org or post at `discussion.nextstrain.org <https://discussion.nextstrain.org>`_.
